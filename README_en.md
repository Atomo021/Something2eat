# Something2eat: ASCII Agent Mini-World
Welcome to Something2eat! Immerse yourself in a small universe of autonomous agents, inspired by the complexity and interactivity of games like **Dwarf Fortress**. Although this mini-world is in its early stages, it lays the groundwork for deeper simulation experiences.

## The Current Mini-Game: The Great Fruit Harvest
In the current version of **Something2eat**, your main objective is to guide your agent (or simply watch them) as they try to consume all the food scattered across the map. Each game is a new challenge, with a randomly generated world filled with resources and obstacles.

Watch as your agent navigates the terrain, manages their energy, and, if they're lucky or prodigious, learns new skills to overcome the challenges the world presents!

## An Algorithmic Creation
It's important to note that while the **idea** and vision behind this mini-game are purely **human**, the entire **code** that brings this world to life has been written **entirely by an artificial intelligence**. This project is a testament to the capabilities of AI in software generation, even for creative and complex concepts.

## An Ambitious Future
Given the focus on AI code generation and the modular nature of this mini-world, the potential of **Something2eat** goes beyond this first iteration. Our ambition is for this project to serve as a platform for developing additional **different mini-games and simulations**, each with its own rules, objectives, and challenges, all born from the same synergy between the human idea and the AI ​​execution.
